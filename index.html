       Just After A Flesh is Divided
       The schismed chasmed skin begins

       Towards its (s)kinfolk
       This is the kin of skin, and perhaps vice versa
       
       Blood Spillers out
       of the crevices of Fanon—
       Expresses itself, from the 
       depths of a crimson emerald ocean, which was and is itself
       
       The skin becomes a flesh becomes a flesh seared                                            divided!
       The dark epidermis seemingly a magnet for trauma
       A magnate for worldmaking
       _____________________________________________
       The shock and awful of it all
       leaves me the opposite of speechless
       insofar as it refuses to leave me behind
 
       We are the afterlives. We are the ghosts
       We are The Wails, penUlthima Thule
       Just before mistakes, just before the ship
       Just before the break, just before the whip
       Was a sweetness, was a cream
       Was a sidewalk, was a dream
       In the dark, of the night
       Laughs a rhythm, supreme
       Was a rapper, was a poet
       Or a thing in, between
       Was a kidney, was a spleen
       Was a thing, fell apart
       And we’re back, to the start
       And we’re back, to square one
       Was a nightmare, was a fetish
       Was a dream just, begun
       
       And When skin rots the musty follows
       Dregs of flesh and weepy hollows
       Angst magnolia, shivering pine
       The winter is ceaseless
       The weather? “Still white today”
       
       Just After A Flesh is Divided
       The schismed chasmed skin begins
       To reach back at the cutting edge
       Towards its (s)kinfolk
       This is the kin of skin, and perhaps vice versa
       
       But the back skin never makes it back
       Instead new skin grows in its place
       The forever of a distance, the roughness of a scar
       This is not to say that healing never was or is, or happened<br>

        The color of money, jealousy, evil envy sickness mold dopamine competition, selfishness, greed. 
        All of this makes sense

        But green makes you think twice. The color of nature, youth, gardens, stable, sustainable life, ecology. 
        These things make a different kind of sense
        
        Is money natural? Is it an inevitability of the entropy of social life? 
        To what extent are ecology and economy synonymous? 
        Max Weber tells me “not very,” insofar as capitalism needed a Protestant Ethic as a foothold 
        to become the thing we know. Capitalism is hardly natural, at least not to me and my people.
        
        Ecology (green), for some reason, feels foreign to black, 
        and economy (Green) cuts black up into little pieces. 
        If black wants to be seen by Green as value, 
        we have to cut ourselves and each other up into little pieces. 
        This is the insecure violence always underwriting a bag secured
        
        Green is, most likely, a dyed facsimile of red, pretending to be a facsimile of green. 
        Green is backed by gold and silver, 
        which is in turn backed by red and black and brown. 
        Every dollar bill secretly bleeds.
        
        Green is crimson disidentified, abstracted alabaster, oppression made shiny, 
        modernity’s most magnanimous weather machine. 
        If green is grass, Green is gross.
        
        Green White is the erotics of reaping the benefits of Red White’s actions 
        while sidestepping its consequences 
        (If what I got to sell is on the cutting edge, where did all the blood go?). 
        The Green White gaze can never see black until it cuts me up into little pieces… 
        so I don’t know why I’m even writing this.
        
        And that is to say Green makes you think twice twice.

        In Unpayable Debt, Denise Ferreira da Silva details the ways in which the direct products of slave labor 
        have no exchange value, even as the slave themself bears exchange value as a commodity. 
        Though she herself does not use the term, Ferreiera da Silva is effectively describing the slave as fixed capital 
        (giving further credence to my hunch that slaves were the first automatons).
        The slave is not allowed to resist, because resistance necessarily 
        disrupts the flow and continuity of the capital which relies on their forces of production 
        and more subtly their inability to possess what those forces produce. 
        Black Green, in the name of fixed capital, demands the perpetual fixation of blackness. 
        
        Fixation as in to affix = “You stay right here on this plantation, boy. Don’t you dare runaway”.
        Fixation as in to fix = “There’s something utterly wrong with you. There’s no way you can live on your own if I don’t civilize you”. 
        Fixation as in to fixate = “Look, a Negro!”.
        
        Langston’s famous kitchen is totally suffused by this mean Green – 
        in the fridges and cabinets  lie lettuce, moldy cheddar, festering sourdough, a detonating raisin. 
        How does Langston possibly grow strong from this? 
        Fred might say he gathers himself by way of a kind of regurgitation and/or “rumination syndrome.” 
        In the same way Phyllis Wheatley’s internalized anti-black poetics might be 
        “nourishing… good for those whom it poisons,” 
        Langston, or more precisely the caterpillar, must chew things over to make more sweet for others 
        the bitter lack of an alternative. 
        But it all still leaves a bad taste in my mouth. 
        I mean yea, roses erupting through concrete are nice and symbolic, 
        but at the end of the day chloroplasts aren’t made for asphalt – a pimped caterpillar still has to pimp out his neighbors.
        Oftentimes to work in the wake is to work as it,
        
        to drown the Mammie Wata who taught you how to wade.

        If money is that most-coveted anti-blurrian crisp CREAM, I'm interested in

        The crop before the CREAM,
        The seeds of the money tree,
        The flesh before the body, and
        The merit before currency. Let me explain
        
        When I used to chase girls around in High School, desperate to belong and to be loved,
        they would deny or defer my efforts in a myriad of ways. 
        One of those ways was by labeling me as “husband material”. 
         
        In other words, while they didn’t want me now, I could take consolation in my potential
        as a worthy partner in the future. 
        “Husband material” wasn’t a terrible thing to be, but it did nothing for me at fourteen, 
        and does nothing for the parts of me that may take no interest in being somebody’s husband. 
        For a teenager to be “Husband material” is for them to have recognizable merit, but, at least for the time being, no currency. 
        
        I imagine that how DuBois felt at school, and how Langston felt in the kitchen, 
        must have had a lot to do with this asymptotic cut between merit and currency, 
        which seems to widen disproportionately for Black folks.
        
        I found my adolescent self jealous of the kids of other races who seemed to have a much easier time with romance, 
        and, while I don’t think I would ever be willing to change the presentation of my character for more immediate favor, 
        sometimes I wished I was more of a stereotype or fetish, just so more people would want me. 
        Brutal as they are, at least fetishes have currency. 
        At least you can exchange that denigration to get some of the things you want out of life.
        
        So the problematic is as such: 
        Black Green is doomed to oscillate between the states of 
        potential value and kinetic fetish, 
        fixed capital and exchangeable commodity, 
        invisibility and the wrong kind of visibility. 
        This is the ontological remainder of the economic and juridical legacies of slavery. 
        It’s not that other ways of being aren’t available, 
        it’s that living differently doesn't pay the bills.
        
        Hence the ongoing battle between the ideal and the pragmatic, 
        which quickly becomes a dual between being a problem and acting like less of one 
        for people who could care less about you. 
        A dollar bill only needs a single token to hold it down these days… 
        But let’s put that thought away for a second.
        
        _______
        
        On one hand, the dollar is worth a lot more than the penny. 
        On the other hand, a green piece of paper is nowhere near worth its weight in copper. 
        If my existence was like that of a dollar bill, 
        I would spend all my time trying to replace the ones in my corners 
        with the biggest number possible, 
        just try to get my numbers up. 
        I would never envy pennies even as I recognized their excessive mettle, 
        their shine, 
        their durability. 
        The dollar bill is little more than what it is symbolically. 
        The penny is so much more than what it is symbolically. 
        What do we do with this?
        
        Is a liberal body like a dollar bill, and flesh like a penny? 
        When Black Panthers march against the Wolves of Wall Street, 
        are they really just penny pinchers stealing back their own value? 
        The Juke Joint bumps, the radio puts an antenna on it and Elvis gets all the credit. 
        We shake our ass and they shake their assets. 
        Surplus is not the same as surplus value.
        
        So where exactly do I put my ante-normative phe-noumeno-logical nonsense? 
        If Green Black is the bind in which I am caught, 
        must all bidness be Coon Bidness? 
        Why do I work my hardest in spaces where I'm not valued? 
        Why do I need Green White to see me cut myself up into little pieces if I wanna pay the bills? 
        If modernity can't afford to acknowledge my merit as currency, 
        why would I ever be interested in being the king of any concrete jungle? 
        Would these problems go away if I dressed like a million bucks, 
        or ordered the Amazon River on Amazon Prime? 
        How much does a black hole cost? 
        Can Green ever be the color of care? 
        If the answer was yes 
        Jay-Z would have probably come to save me by now…
        
        But one thing I know is this: 
        If I picked up all the pennies in the world, 
        we would make one hell of a green book. 
        After all, money only matters when you’re keeping score.
